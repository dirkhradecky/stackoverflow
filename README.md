## Installation

To run the code Python 3.x and the following libraries are needed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

The used versions can be seen in the pyproject.toml file

## Project Motivation

For this project I use the Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data from 2024. The data can be downloaded here: [Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2024](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/jo7n4k8s/production/262f04c41d99fea692e0125c342e446782233fe4.zip/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2024.zip)

I'm interested in the following questions:

**1. Which languages are the most popular and widely used?**

**2. Which languages currently offer the highest salaries?**

**3. What is the proportion of remote work and are there differences depending on the developer type**
