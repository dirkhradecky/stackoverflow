## Project Motivation

For this project I use the Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data from 2024. The data can be downloaded here: [Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2024](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/jo7n4k8s/production/262f04c41d99fea692e0125c342e446782233fe4.zip/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2024.zip)

I'm interested in the following questions:

**1. Which technologies are the most popular and widely used?**

- Are there differences depending on the region?
- Are there differences based on the experience of developers or developer groups?
- Which technologies are currently being used the most, and which ones would the participants like to work with in the future?

**2. Which technologies currently offer the highest salaries?**

- Are there differences depending on the country/region?

**3. What developer profiles exist, and how do they differ from each other?**
