## Installation

To run the code Python 3.x and the following libraries are needed:

- pandas
- matplotlib

## Project Motivation

For this project I use the Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data from 2024. The data can be downloaded here: [Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2024](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/jo7n4k8s/production/262f04c41d99fea692e0125c342e446782233fe4.zip/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2024.zip)

I'm interested in the following questions:

**1. Which languages are the most popular and widely used?**

**2. Which languages currently offer the highest salaries?**

**3. What is the proportion of remote work and are there differences depending on the developer type**

## File Description

There is a notebook here where the analysis is done.

## Results

The main findings can are shown in the medium post here: [Unlocking 2024 Tech Trends: Insights from the Stackoverflow Developer Survey](https://medium.com/@dirk.hradecky/unlocking-2024-tech-trends-insights-from-the-stackoverflow-developer-survey-50ba5909e0d0)
